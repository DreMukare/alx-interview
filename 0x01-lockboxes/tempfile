You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. 
Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

Prototype: def canUnlockAll(boxes)
boxes is a list of lists
A key with the same number as a box opens that box
You can assume all keys will be positive integers
There can be keys that do not have boxes
The first box boxes[0] is unlocked
Return True if all boxes can be opened, else return False



- first check if boxes if empty, if it is return False
- create variable unlockable set to true
- loop through boxes
- loop will start at 1 because first box is always unlocked
- check for current index value in all boxes starting from first
- if index value not found by the time we get to loop change unlockable to false
- else loop continues
